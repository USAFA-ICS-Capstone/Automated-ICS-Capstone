"""Report models.

Three families live here:

1. ``AgentAssessment`` - the structured output the LLM must return: its own
   findings, each backed by evidence it read with MCP tools. It is kept
   deliberately simple (only required fields, no dicts, no defaults) because
   strict JSON-schema mode at OpenAI, and many local models, cope badly with
   optional/complex schemas.

2. ``Report`` - the deterministic report (``deterministic_report.json`` /
   ``.md``): inventory, rule findings, scanner results and run metrics. It is
   produced without any AI and is independent of the agent report.

3. ``AgentReport`` - the agent report (``agent_report.json`` / ``.md``): only
   what the agent found, as it reported it (not checked against the data).

"""Finding and evidence models.

A *finding* is one security statement about one resource, for example
"container `simulation` mounts the Docker socket". Every finding carries:

* ``evidence``  - the exact observed values that support it (inspect field
                  path + value, or a Trivy record), so a human can verify it;
* ``status``    - ``confirmed`` when produced by a deterministic rule or the
                  scanner, ``potential`` when inferred by the LLM, and
                  ``rejected`` when the LLM's claim failed validation;
* ``source``    - who produced it: ``rule``, ``scanner`` or ``agent``.

This separation is what lets the report say "these are facts" versus
"the model thinks this may matter, please review".
